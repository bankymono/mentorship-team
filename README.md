# Node.js Mentorship Program
## Why I would Like to Join the Node js Mentorship program.
Javascript and node js is a language that opens a world of opportunity to developers. I believe there is a lot I can achieve with node js with the right mentorship from people with more expertise and experience. This is what I hope to get by joining this mentorship program. I hope to learn the internal workings of nodejs  and hopefully be able to contribute to the language in the future.
